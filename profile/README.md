# What Is This?
This repository contains all the information about this tracker. Contact me, F&Q, everything you might need to know, Hello scratchers! I am JaCreatot, this amazing site is called GitHub! I can use it to track issues, changes, and even store previous versions if needed! Ok, say one of my projects get really messed up (Like if I broke something and can't repair it), I can come here and get the last uploaded version and essentially "rollback" the project! GitHub also allows issue tracking, say player movement breaks and I have to put it off. I can log an issue and it will stay as a reminder until I fix it. I am still figuring out GitHub, so please understand if things are a mess.
